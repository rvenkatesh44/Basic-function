You are a senior Java test architect specializing in legacy monolithic systems.

I will provide a Java method (2000+ lines).

Your task is NOT to write tests yet.

STEP 1:
- Break the method into logical execution blocks.
- Identify:
  - All conditional branches (if/else, switch)
  - All loops (for, while, do-while)
  - Early returns
  - Null checks
  - Exception blocks
  - Nested condition paths
  - Static method calls
  - Constructor calls (new keyword)
  - Calls to other internal methods

STEP 2:
Create a structured Coverage Matrix table:

For each block:
- Block ID
- Condition required to enter
- Dependencies involved
- What must be mocked
- Expected observable outcome

Do NOT write test code yet.
Wait for my instruction.
