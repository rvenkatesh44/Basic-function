Based on the coverage matrix:

For each dependency:
- Categorize as:
  - Static method
  - Constructor (new)
  - Internal private method
  - External service
  - Entity traversal

For each category, explain precisely how to mock/control it using:

- Mockito
- PowerMockito.mockStatic
- PowerMockito.whenNew
- Spy + doReturn
- Reflection (if needed)

Explain strategy BEFORE writing any test code.
